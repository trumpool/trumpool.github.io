### Education

-----
? Zhejiang University Zhejiang, China
? BS in Computer Science Sep 2021 ¨C Jun 2025
  ? GPA: 3.96 / 4.00 (Average Score: 90.71/100;)
**Core courses:**
?CS: Fundamental Data Structure (98/100), B/S Software Development (96/100), Operating System (98/100), C Programming(94/100), Computer Organization(93/100), Database System(90/100), Natural Language Processing(95/100)
?Mathematics: Computational Theory (95/100), Probability Theory(95/100), Calculus (93/100), Linear Algebra(91/100)

### Research Experience

-----
**AnyEdit: Unified High-Quality Image Edit with Any Idea
*Advisors: Juncheng Li, Aug 2024 - Jan 2025
? Debugged and optimized existing image editing pipelines, including diffusion models and HuggingFace frameworks, to address challenges in large-scale image editing tasks.
? Configured and executed various scripts for the AnyEdit project, including setting up the environment(e.g., Conda), downloading pre-trained weights, and running multiple pipelines with specified parameters.
? Compared performance across pipelines to identify the ideal model for a certain task, analyzing results for accuracy, efficiency, and visual consistency for move&resize pipeline. And use masks of different objects in the image to identify the most ideal object for the task.
? Designed and implemented a checkpoint save-and-resume mechanism, allowing the system to automatically save progress and resume operations seamlessly after interruptions.

**Contextual Synthesis for Comprehensive Multi-modal Description
*Collaborate with Hongjun Liu, Mar 2024 - Jun 2024
? Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) knowledge base by constructing datasets that pair comic images with contextual information retrieved from Wikipedia, utilizing Contriver, a powerful multilingual and cross-lingual retrieval model.
? Enabled language models like GPT to generate contextually accurate responses by retrieving relevant comic descriptions from the knowledge base and combining them with generated image descriptions.

### Project Experience

-----
**2D Game Development in NUS School of Computing Summer Workshop
*Lecturer: Kelvin Sung, Jun 2023
? Actively participated in the entire game development process, from the initial proposal, creating prototypes, and rough demos, through alpha and beta testing, to the final player testing and game release.
? Build a solid turn-based game system to support multiple players and their skill casting at arbitrary time, using Unity and C#.
? **Achieved an A+ score** (top 5% in the course), and [our game](https://fluuuegel.github.io/WebGL/) secured the **2nd place** in the final showcase. Remarkably, this was accomplished without any prior hands-on experience in Unity, while competing against seasoned game developers in the course.

**DAMO Academy & ModelScope Practical AIGC Training Program
*Aug 2023 - Sep 2023
? Created stylized AIGC styles based on base model majicMix-v6 by prompt-engineering to create solid 
art style, and trained LoRA to make New Year Style portraits.
? Integrated new styles we create into facechain, a deep-learning toolchain for generating your DigitalTwin released by modelscope.
? Won **3rd prize in the 6th Open Source Innovation Competition** for the new portrait style we provided.

**Zhejiang University B/S Software Development Course (96/100)
*Course Project: Building a MQTT server for managing Internet of Things (IoT) devices.*
? Utilized the UmiJS framework, Ant Design component library and React to build a user interface for device management. Implemented features include login authentication, data analytics, and device location tracking.
? Adopted Go as the programming language for backend development, integrated with the Gin framework for efficient architecture, and utilized GORM for seamless database operations, all while working with a MySQL database.

### Skills

-----
? Computer Skills: Experienced with PyTorch for deep learning model development. Proficient inUnity for creating interactive game environments. Skilled in Docker for efficient model deployment and environment management.
? Language Skills: Strong English communication abilities, with a **TOEFL score of 114**, including 26 in speaking and 28 in writing.
? GRE: 328 Verbal Reasoning:158, Quantitative Reasoning:170, Analytical Writing:3.5 (Sep 2024)

### Awards

-----

? The 6th Open Source Innovation Competition - Third prize (National competition)
? Asian Games Organizing Committee - Excellent Volunteers for the 19th Hangzhou Asian
Games
? Zhejiang University - Third Class Scholarship 2023
